  welcome: `*Hello FIRST_NAME,*

Bus Eta Bot is a Telegram bot which can tell you how long you have to wait for your bus to arrive. 

To get started, try sending me a bus stop code to get etas for, such as \`96049\`.

Alternatively, you can also search for bus stops by sending me an inline query. To try this out, use the button below, 
or type my username (@BusEtaBot) followed by a bus stop code, description or road name in any chat.

Thanks for trying out Bus Eta Bot! If you find Bus Eta Bot useful, do help to spread the word or use /feedback and 
leave some feedback to help make Bus Eta Bot even better!

If you're stuck, you can get help with using Bus Eta Bot by sending /help.

Regards,  
*J*  
Bus Eta Bot Developer`
